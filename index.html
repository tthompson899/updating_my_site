      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img class="responsive-img circle" src="images/about_me/tiffany.jpg" alt="picture of Tiffany" />
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Tiffany and I enjoy creating web sites and applications that engage the user and provide useful information
        to the end user. My tools of choice are HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery but I can also build with the full stack utilizing
        skills like Node.js, Apache, MongoDB and MySQL. I enjoy improving sites and applications and constantly find websites that
        need a facelift, especially those geared toward nonprofits.
        You can find me at meetups to stay up to date in the industry and particularly events geared toward women in tech and volunteering
        at Bold Idea in an effort to keep the next generation interested and excited about code.
      </p>
      <h3>Have more time? Read my full story below or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxyLoVOL_gY4ei5X8UE1ZzQ380NXHKCmA">watch my journey into video series on youtube</a></h3>
      <p>My story starts in 2008 when a friend of mine was working on the computer and told me she was making the website
        for our student organization at the time. She later on told me about Management Information Systems and meet with
        the advisor for more information. The next day, I spoke with an advisor who told me that I should take a class over
        the summer at a community college. That summer I learned to create programs using C++ and got excited about what could
        be created by technology, I enrolled in the Management Information Systems program at my school (Texas A&M University-Commerce)
        where the curriculum mixed Computer Science with Business courses.<p>
      <p>
        Throughout my time in college, I was learning PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS and ASP.Net and I enjoyed mostly every moment.
        After college, I thought I would land a job in the tech industry but it turns out if you don't have ANY experience no one will
        give you second look. I continued life finding employment at TxIS were I was laid off and Torchmark where I was a
        Data Integrity Analyst, reviewing reports, helping out with month end costing (data entry) and researching mainframe
        for missing information. Throughout my time being employed, I explored learning to code on my own online at Codecademy, Treehouse, SoloLearn
        and FreeCodeCamp as well as attending meetups like Girl Develop It and Women Who Code.<p>
      <p>
        After three years at Torchmark, I decided it was time to follow my passion of being a developer, so I applied and got accepted
        into a coding bootcamp called Coding Dojo and ultimately, left my position at Torchmark to start a new journey. While at the Dojo,
        I learned Full Stack Development skills in the LAMP, MEAN and Ruby on Rails stack including using frameworks
        such as CodeIgniter, AngularJS, JSON and RESTful web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's so many avenues that can be explored through technology but I've decided to lay my hat (at least for right now ;))
        in Front End Development. I realized that I was always going on to sites and looking to see how the interface looked and
        how easy/difficult it was to get to different information. I know there is still so much to learn and am confident that I can
        pick things up quickly because of being in the coding bootcamp where we are learning so much in a small amount of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently seeking out a new opportunity to utilize my newly acquired skills. If you're looking to hire a
        developer who is excited about the industry and ready to jump in to contribute to get things done,
        I'm who you should call.
